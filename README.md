## Pavilion
Pavilion is a mellow dark theme inspired by gold-trimmed pavilions, with washed-out blue and orange and bright "gold trims".

This extension contains the original Pavilion theme, and a darker "night" version with purple accents instead of orange.

The theme is currently tested for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python and Markdown files, with more language support on the way.
